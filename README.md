# Minda
Minda is tool for benchmarking structural variant (SV) callers that:
* requires no prepocessing of VCF files
* standardizes VCF records for compatibility with both germline and somatic SV callers
* benchmarks against a single VCF input file or ensemble call set created from multiple VCF input files
* filters VCF records with an optional BED input file.
